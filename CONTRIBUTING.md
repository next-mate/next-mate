# Contributing to NextMate

## Workflow

* Fork the project.
* Make your bug fix or feature addition.
* Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

Please make sure that you have [set up your user name and email address](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) for use with Git. Strings such as `silly nick name <root@localhost>` look really stupid in the commit history of a project.

Pull requests for bug fixes must be based on the `master` branch whereas pull requests for new features must be based on the `develop` branch.

Due to time constraints, we are not always able to respond as quickly as we would like. Please do not take delays personal and feel free to remind us if you feel that we forgot to respond.
